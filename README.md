[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/i7fp97q9nc5uw5kf?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/zhengbli/typescript-tmlanguage)

This repository contains TmLanguage files that are consumed by TypeScript editors and plugins such as [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), [The TypeScript Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin), [Atom TypeScript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript), and possibly others.

# Contributing

The XML files are generated from the YAML files, so contributors should hand-modify the YAML files, and XML files should only be generated by the [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) plugin.

## Tests

Test are run from within the ```tests``` folder

``` sh
cd tests
npm install         # Installs dependencies required for testing
npm test            # Compiles & runs tests
```

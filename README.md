# TypeScript-TmLanguage

This repository contains TmLanguage files that are consumed by TypeScript editors and plugins such as [Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode), [The TypeScript Sublime Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-Sublime-Plugin), [Atom TypeScript](https://github.com/TypeStrong/atom-typescript), and possibly others.

# Contributing

The XML files are generated from the YAML files, so contributors should hand-modify the YAML files, and XML files should only be generated by the [AAAPackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/AAAPackageDev) plugin.
